## Distance Calculator (Arduino)
This project is an analog to digital dist. calculator. 


## Components:
-Arduino Uno

-16*2 LCD Display

-Ultrasonic dist. sensor

-250k ohms potentiometer

-Breadboard+ Jumper wires


## How It Works
It uses an ultrasonic dist. sensor to measure the dist. which is then printed on a LCD display.
